## About
http://head-lines.herokuapp.com/welcome

`HEADLINES` was brought to you by Becky Newborn and Gene Yoo. Its intent is to provide aggregated news headlines based on a user's preferences for news sources. All news headlines were sourced from News API (https://newsapi.org/), a HTTP REST API for searching and retrieving live articles from all over the web. This README is for the API backend that supports the `HEADLINES` website. We hope you enjoy!
